 # Tic Tac Toe Game in C

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, written in C programming language. The game was developed using the Turbo C IDE, and it supports two players.

## Project Overview

The **Tic Tac Toe Game** is a simple, two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal. If no player achieves this, the game ends in a tie.

### Game Rules:
- Two players take alternate turns.
- **Player 1** is assigned the **'X'** symbol.
- **Player 2** is assigned the **'O'** symbol.
- The first player to align three of their symbols (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the grid is full and no player has aligned their symbols, the game results in a tie.

## Features
- Simple command-line interface.
- Turn-based gameplay.
- Detects win conditions or a tie.
- Resettable for multiple rounds.
